  <Comments>Bird uttering first 2 calls not SEEN calling. Calls were heard at very close range after playback (once) of the song. Visual confirmation thereafter.UPDATE: when visiting the site 3rd August 2013, I did get the same calls after playback of the song. This time the birds were not seen, but they repeatedly uttered this call at very close range (between song strophes). So, the identity as Marsh Tapaculo for this particular call is still not 100%, but at least very close to that!</Comments>
