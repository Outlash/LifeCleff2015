  <Comments>Song and calls from same trio as in XC121912. Perched about 15m up in small tree at edge. Male was a gray-breasted type, female did not seem particularly strongly tawny on face. Female seems to have a lower-pitched voice than the other two, the highest voice probably from young. Recorded well after playback. img:http://www.flickr.com/photos/8013969@N03/8443246886/bird-seen:yesplayback-used:yes</Comments>
