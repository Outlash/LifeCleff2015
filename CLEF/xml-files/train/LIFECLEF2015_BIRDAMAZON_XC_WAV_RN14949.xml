  <Comments>Terra firme forest. Identified by Andrew Whittaker, who wrote:This is a very agitated call of Tiny Tyrant-Manakin Tyranneutes virescens. They have this call in the canopy and it's not at all like their song from understory! The bird's call is a little faster than normal but easy to ID. May have been alarming at a snake. I recall one excited bird watched doing this near the tower many years ago! bird-seen:noplayback-used:no""</Comments>
