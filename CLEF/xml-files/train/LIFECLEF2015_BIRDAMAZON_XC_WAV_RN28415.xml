  <Content>Single note calls, male song and female song</Content>
  <Comments>Small group (at least one male including the holotype of concepcion and at least one female) foraging.  First calls of immaculata are the short single note calls in duet.  This is followed later on the track by various examples of the male song given by the holotype of subspecies concepcion.  After the last male song is a female responding in a slightly higher song.  However, at the same time I am readying playback and the last note of the female song has playback on top of it.  The playback is of Alvarez et al. 2007 CD, which led to the birds being silent but the male moving and being netted fairly swiftly.  All calls and songs are natural with no playback prior to the recording.</Comments>
