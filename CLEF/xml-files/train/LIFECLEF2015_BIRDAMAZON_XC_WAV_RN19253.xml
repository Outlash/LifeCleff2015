  <Comments>This individual bird and at least 2 others, started dawn-singing BEFORE 4.45 AM and lasted MORE 1 than one hour until it got lighter just before 6.00 AMThere is a very neat ending of some phrases I had never heard before... ie. at 6:12, at 11:17, and also at 26:44. Then, at 43:22 you start hearing interaction calls from these very same Black-billed Thrushes.At 42:33 you can hear the first Great Kiskadee(s) calling in the background, and by 45:00 the cool bizarre interaction calls (almost always heard only at dawn -by me!) that these kiskadees make.~~~~~~~~Heavy bat calling at 6:30 and at 8:00, plus bats' wings VERY close to the mic at 19:14 - saw up to 6 individuals.At 28:27 you can hear the calls of the introduced Lepidodactylus lugubris Gecko.bird-seen:noplayback-used:no</Comments>
