  <Comments>Good afternoon friends who enjoy birds like me.Every day to go to work , step next to a park that is in the city where many birds can hear in the background to . A puzzled me because when I thought about answering the corner whistling , I realized he was approaching in flight because he heard her singing closer and closer and to my surprise a couple of exciting birds started flying in circles above me with low flights and  singing in the same way . At this time , the singing ranged with small  screams  like hawks. Flew like swallows, be swift and sudden reversals as if they were played fetch. This lasted a few minutes to distance themselves . As step by Local every day , I noticed some details on other occasions . Although almost no clarity at this time (5:40 am ) , I could notice that birds are small to medium sized ( as a 40cm wingspan ) , slender bodies , apparently grayish coloration , almost slightly blue . It seems a kind of owl, but by flight , very fast , I think they are hard . I made a video that catches a glimpse of them . No audio guys will notice between 2:40 and end the singing of these birds . Indentificar love this species . Perhaps the lookout park learn , but I prefer this method here . Regards .. Hugs to all .bird-seen:yes""</Comments>
